# Hi, I’m Lee

I’m an Electrical and Electronics Engineering Technologist graduate from Kenya with a growing passion for embedded systems, automation, and practical engineering projects. My background is hands-on. I’ve worked with real hardware, real tools, and real systems. I’m currently exploring how software ties everything together.

### What I’m Building
- Fuel monitoring and dispensing systems using ESP32  
- Small robotics projects for autonomous navigation  
- Industrial automation exercises using PLCs, ladder logic, and HMI simulations  
- PCB design experiments as I learn Altium, KiCad, and AutoCAD Electrical  

### Skills I’m Growing Fast
- Embedded systems programming  
- ESP32 projects (sensors, LCDs, relays, WebSockets, WiFi features)  
- PCB design and documentation  
- PLC logic, VFD setups, and motor control basics  
- Robotics fundamentals and simple autonomous algorithms  

### Tools I’m Learning
- TIA Portal  
- AutoCAD Electrical  
- Altium Designer
- SolidWorks
- MATLAB and basic Simulink  
- KiCad for PCB layouts  
- Proteus for circuit simulation  

### A Bit About Me
I like building things that solve real problems. If I can wire it, automate it, or make it think for itself, I’m interested.  
I’m also always improving my coding skills to match my hardware knowledge.

### Current Goals
- Build a solid engineering portfolio here on GitHub  

### Reach Out
If you want to collaborate or chat about embedded systems, automation, PCB design, or robotics, I’m always open to learning and working with others.
